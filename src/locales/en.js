            { question: "What level do I need to start?", answer: "We recommend a minimum A2 level. If you are starting from absolute zero, there are better options for the first steps. Our strength is getting you unstuck from B1-B2." },
            { question: "How are the online classes?", answer: "Video call, one hour. You have already worked on the material before (flipped classroom). The session is 100% conversation, correction, and practice of real situations." },
            { question: "What happens if I have to cancel a class?", answer: "Notify us 24 hours in advance and we reschedule without problem. Less than 24 hours, the class is lost. We are flexible, but the commitment is mutual." },
