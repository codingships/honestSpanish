The short answer? **Between 600 and 800 hours of deliberate practice to reach a solid B2 level.** If someone promised you fluency in three months studying 15 minutes a day, they lied to you.

Let's be brutally honest. The language industry lives on selling hope. Apps with green owls, magic 30-day courses, "revolutionary" methods. But after years of teaching Spanish to hundreds of students, the mathematical reality always prevails.

## What does "fluency" really mean?

Before talking about hours, let's define the goal. When in **Español Honesto** we talk about fluency to live in Spain, we don't mean reciting Don Quixote. We mean:

*   Understanding what the doctor tells you without using Google Translate.
*   Solving a problem with your internet company over the phone (the final boss of Spanish bureaucracy).
*   Having dinner with Spanish friends and not staying silent looking at your phone because you got lost in the conversation.

This is a **B2 (Upper Intermediate)** level according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). It is the turning point where the language ceases to be a barrier and becomes a tool.

## The Real Numbers (CEFR Levels)

According to data from the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) and our own experience in the classroom, this is the real breakdown for a native English speaker:

### A1-A2 (The Advanced Tourist) - 150-200 hours
This is where most app users stay. You can order a beer, say your name, and ask where the bathroom is. Useful for vacations, insufficient for living.

### B1 (The Stagnation) - 350-400 accumulated hours
You start building complex sentences. You understand the main ideas. But you get tired quickly. A conversation of more than 20 minutes fries your brain. Many expats live trapped here for years.

### B2 (Freedom) - 600-800 accumulated hours
This is where the magic happens. You can nuance. You can make jokes (and understand them). You can consume real Spanish culture (cinema, books, podcasts for natives). This is where you live in Spanish.

## Why don't the numbers add up for you?

"But I've been in Spain for 2 years, I should be fluent."

Let's do the math. If you go to classes 2 hours a week and do 1 hour of homework, that's 3 hours a week. In a year (minus vacations) that's about 120 hours.
At that pace, **it will take you 6 years to reach B2**.

That is the reality no one wants to see. Living in Spain doesn't teach you Spanish by osmosis. You need intensity.

## The 8-10 Month Method

At **Español Honesto**, our program is designed to compress those 600 hours into a period of 8 to 10 months. It's not magic, it's work density.

How do we do it?
1.  **Flipped Classroom**: You don't come to class to have grammar explained. You watch that at home. You come to class to use it.
2.  **Comprehensible Input**: We bombard you with real Spanish adapted to your level, not with textbook sentences from 1990.
3.  **Spacing Effect**: We review vocabulary just before your brain deletes it.

If you are willing to dedicate real time, the results are real. If you are looking for a shortcut, there are many other academies that will be happy to charge you the monthly fee for the next 6 years.

Your time is worth more than that.
