But you get tired quickly. A conversation of more than 20 minutes fries your brain. Many expats live trapped here for years.\r\n\r\n### B2 (Freedom) - 600-800 accumulated hours\r\nThis is where the magic happens. You can nuance. You can make jokes (and understand them).

Yes, at first you'll understand 40%. But you need to expose your brain to real speed and intonation. In our classes, we analyze news clips, radio debates, and real interviews.\r\n\r\n### 2.

At **Español Honesto**, we use the flipped classroom so you practice structures until they come out naturally, without thinking.\r\n\r\n### 3.

When you don't know a word, explain it with others (circumlocution).\r\n\r\n### 4. Accept the mistake\r\nAt the B1 level, fear of being wrong paralyzes. To get to B2, you have to accept that you're going to sound a bit silly for a while. It's the price to pay for future fluency.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe B1 plateau is where most people quit.

La industria de los idiomas vive de vender esperanza. Apps con búhos verdes, cursos mágicos de 30 días, métodos \"revolucionarios\". Pero después de enseñar español durante años a cientos de alumnos, la realidad matemática siempre se impone.\r\n\r\n## ¿Qué significa realmente \"fluidez\"?\r\n\r\nAntes de hablar de horas, definamos el objetivo. Cuando en **Español Honesto** hablamos de fluidez para vivir en España, no nos referimos a recitar el Quijote. Nos referimos a:\r\n\r\n*   Entender lo que te dice el médico sin usar Google Translate.\r\n*   Resolver un problema con tu compañía de internet por teléfono (el jefe final de la burocracia española).\r\n*   Tener una cena con amigos españoles y no quedarte callado mirando el móvil porque te has perdido en la conversación.\r\n\r\nEsto es un nivel **B2 (Intermedio Alto)** según el Marco Común Europeo de Referencia (MCER). Es el punto de inflexión donde el idioma deja de ser una barrera y se convierte en una herramienta.\r\n\r\n## Los números reales (Niveles CEFR)\r\n\r\nSegún datos del Foreign Service Institute (FSI) y nuestra propia experiencia en el aula, este es el desglose real para un hablante nativo de inglés:\r\n\r\n### A1-A2 (El turista avanzado) - 150-200 horas\r\nAquí es donde se quedan la mayoría de los usuarios de apps. Puedes pedir una cerveza, decir tu nombre y preguntar dónde está el baño. Es útil para vacaciones, insuficiente para vivir.\r\n\r\n### B1 (El estancamiento) - 350-400 horas acumuladas\r\nEmpiezas a construir frases complejas. Entiendes las ideas principales. Pero te cansas rápido. Una conversación de más de 20 minutos te deja el cerebro frito. Muchos expatriados viven años atrapados aquí.\r\n\r\n### B2 (La libertad) - 600-800 horas acumuladas\r\nAquí ocurre la magia. Puedes matizar. Puedes hacer bromas (y entenderlas). Puedes consumir cultura española real (cine, libros, podcasts para nativos). Aquí es donde vives en español.\r\n\r\n## ¿Por qué las cuentas no te salen?\r\n\r\n\"Pero llevo 2 años en España, debería ser fluido\".\r\n\r\nHagamos las matemáticas. Si vas a clases 2 horas a la semana y haces 1 hora de deberes, son 3 horas a la semana. Al año (quitando vacaciones) son unas 120 horas.\r\nA ese ritmo, **tardarás 6 años en llegar al B2**.\r\n\r\nEsa es la realidad que nadie quiere ver. Vivir en España no te enseña español por ósmosis. Necesitas intensidad.\r\n\r\n## El método de los 8-10 meses\r\n\r\nEn **Español Honesto**, nuestro programa está diseñado para comprimir esas 600 horas en un periodo de 8 a 10 meses. No es magia, es densidad de trabajo.\r\n\r\n¿Cómo lo hacemos?\r\n1.  **Clase Invertida**: No vienes a clase a que te explique la gramática. Eso lo ves en casa. A clase vienes a usarla.\r\n2.  **Input Comprensible**: Te bombardeamos con español real adaptado a tu nivel, no con frases de libro de texto de 1990.\r\n3.  **Spacing Effect**: Revisamos el vocabulario justo antes de que tu cerebro lo borre.\r\n\r\nSi estás dispuesto a dedicar tiempo real, los resultados son reales.
